> Well, it’s finally that time. As a lot of you know I’ve been thinking about leaving for a while (yeah I know I talk a lot about it so maybe you saw this coming). Feel like I haven’t been included in the new memes and stuff, lol, so easier for me to say goodbye. I had a good time but might play a different game and hang in a different discord. The banter was fine but my psychiatrist says most of my anxiety comes from trying to corrale 24 adult bonobo monkeys twice a week inside The Black Temple. I got asked to tank a lot of mobs and drop a lot of totems of wrath, but it is becoming ridiculous and I’m starting to see members of the public as having health bars, might be why I didn’t pass my drivers test last week, instead of focusing on the road I was thinking about why Hotcarl was banned from disc…

> I'll say this one last time, I dont give a FUCK how many times my class leader tells me to sunder armour. I will NEVER do it. FUCK that. You think im gonna sacrifice my precious rage for an ability that does 0 damage? SUCK MY DICK. You wanna go check the logs and call me out for not sundering? I fucking dare you because you'll be looking right at the #1 damage dealer cuck. Fuck sixfoot, fuck simo, and FUCK ZEMESTRA. You will NEVER benefit from sunder armour.

> What the fuck did you just fucking say about IDS, you little Shub? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in Northshire Abbey, and I've been involved in numerous healer parses in TBC, and I have over 300 confirmed rank 1s. I am trained in Pain Suppression and I'm the top overhealer in the entire GT armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another health bar. I will heal you the fuck up with crits the likes of which has never been seen before on Azeroth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with speccing that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of bulkerzoids across the Outlands and your 50 gold is being wasted right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that keeps out the pathetic little thing you call your CoH. You're fucking healed, corn. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can top you up in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my healcom. Not only am I extensively trained in divine spirit, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the druid's innervates and I will use it to its full extent to keep the group alive in this contnent, you little shit. If only you could have known what RETRIBUSHOON your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will have higher spirit you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, spatchcock.

> Liquid unironically thinks they can win the race against Gingi, a man who has a daily intake of 450 grams of pure lean protein feeding his bulging muscles and 200 billion brain neurons. The electricity this man generates from perfectly executing his rotation with a 100% uptime is enough to power the whole echo facility. What does Liquid have? Trill? Dont make me laugh. I think we all know who wins this

> tuesday approaches again 星期二再次临近 many weeks since demon man silence poultry 自恶魔人沉默家禽以 来的 removal of fight haste 消除攻击匆忙 ice storm corporation defeats armadillo worshipers 冰暴公司击败犰狳崇拜者 terocone flower suffer strange price fluctuation 特洛酮花遭受奇怪的价格波动 return to private server and legends grow 回归私人服务器，传奇成长

> This is so FUCKED
>Is this some kind of joke? Who the FUCK thought it was acceptable or “cool” to make haste potion not stack with dragonstrike????? I literally spent 4k EACH to craft these pieces of shit week 4 of tier 6 in order to impress my guild’s egirl (already ML’d her ashes so I’m thinking I’m less than a month away from having a girlfriend), but then I see sarthes post and they are literally WORSE THAN ANY WEAPON THAT STACKS WITH HASTE POT, plus I fucking PASSED on Siphons week one.. yeah yeah, have a laugh, but saying items are bis when you know they aren’t is misinformation, which is a crime. And I WILL report to the proper authorities and to wowhead. I won’t be letting this one go easily, and I expect better from the community in sunwell.

> hey guys, mind control is a pretty spooky ability (raz p1, instead of teaching his students he does 30kdps/s to one target) that more or less needs direct attention from priests the moment he stops teaching his students.
>I found the spell id and added it to my raid frames as a square and it shows up on the raid frames as an indication that this guy's gonna have his mind controlled. The spell id is 40585 if you have raid frames that you can do stuff like that to (I use luna squares).
>All other mind related activity stops while the priest casting mind control presses the button, or tank healers who's tanks target are dead to control the fuck out of the bosses mind.
>I have squares set up for a bunch of other useful stuff too
>roll on hit gear (41485), run mob outside of MC range (41376), blood boil on raid leader (42005), allowing this to happen again (31340) are all helpful to know when people are gonna be thinking about quitting raiding.

> shut the fuck up about videos - youre a fucking grown adult you should be able to amuse yourself
>if youre relying on a degenerate like beej to make a video thats like expecting ferguson to top dps on his mage - its just not going to happen
>you need to get off your FUCKING chair and walk around the block and also read a FUCKING book once in awhile because you have become a pathetic morsel
>a morsel that i would just eat in 1 bite - like i wouldnt even have to chew, it would be like that feeling when youre not sure if you can swallow your morsel or if you need to chew more
>and you just say FUCK THIS im the man and you swallow and hurt you neck but you put it down the gullet where it belongs
>so if i hear anyone ever talk about FUCKING videos when we are busy swallowing huge morsels without chewing then i will be the first person to inspect everyones morsel and see if that FUCKING thing needs to be chewed or not because i am sick and tired of talking about videos and morsels goddamn it you guys always making me chew your FUCKING morsels ive had a gutful of this lack of chewing
>if you guys dont get your FUCKING molars and incisors working to break these morsels down i swear to god i will treat you all like the morsels you are and i will engage my LOWER and UPPER jaw and crush you all like the fleas on the back of the morsel i am about to consume no sweat not even looking at it
>and look this message is not FUCKING sponsored by big oral and dental care its just a subject i am passionate about so dont check the guild vault gold balance between 2nd and 3rd brushes or i will be there to intercept your gaze and i will FUCKING bite your eyes out of your FUCKING skull like im chewing the FUCKING flavour out of your hubba bubba in 4 tactical bites
>anyway happy easter dont you FUCKING dare eat chocolate after brushing

> please for the love of hotcarl if i get one fucking chimprimatezee from anyone in the receptacle saying that you're meant to be their 10th humina but you're either homina or in a different bugado i will gkick you this is not a spatchcockum its a bulkerzoid

> Dagg came to me in desperate shape in 2017 - he was politically dead, losing in a landslide to a very good Achievement Commisioner Alvantle, who was loaded up with gold and great achievement point numbers. Dagg had low points, bad polls, and no proto drake, but he said that if i would endorse him, he could win. And i didn't know Alvantle well so i said 'lets give it a shot Dagg'. When I Endorsed him, it was as though…a nuclear weapon went off.
>I also fixed his campaign, which had completely fallen apart. I was all in for Dagg, and he beat Alvantle, but after the Race, when ach points were being stolen by the corrupt Council process in Discord, and Dagg was going down ten thousand points a day, along with now-loot master Sixfoot, I sent in the GTBI and the GT class leaders, and the reputation theft immediately ended, just prior to them running out of the hand ins required. I stopped his Exalted from being stolen.
>And now Daggy DeSanctimonious is playing games! The Fake News asks him if he’s going to run if President Shub runs, and he says - “I’m only focused on the Immortal Achievement, I’m not looking into the future.” Well, in terms of loyalty and titles, that’s really not the right answer.
>This is just like in 2015 and 2016, a Discord assault (collusion!) when the Corrupt council fought me to the end until i won, and then they couldnt have been nicer or more supportive. The GT street journal loved low energy Sixfoot and a succession of other people as they rapidly disappeared from sight, finally falling in line with me after i farmed up Baron mount, ZG raptor and tiger, one by one.
>We're in exactly the same position now. They will keep coming after us GT, but ultimately we will win. Put GT first and MAKE GT IMMORTAL AGAIN
