I met a traveller from an antique land,
<br>Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
<br>Stand in the desert... Near them, on the sand,
<br>Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
<br>And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
<br>Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
<br>Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
<br>The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
<br>And on the pedestal, these words appear:

```bash
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
```

Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
<br>Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
<br>The lone and level sands stretch far away.”

Percy Bysshe Shelley *(11 January 1818)*.
