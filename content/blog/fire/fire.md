maccas and ratsplosion were both done in gouache, testing out the medium. definitely missed a few things, maccas for example didn't really capture the orange glow of the flames.

trump tower was done with these acrylic paint pens, attempted to very quickly replicate the viral photo of a tesla cybertruck that had exploded out the front of trump tower in vegas. wild times!
