## First attempt

I was browsing Project Gutenberg earlier in the year looking for some books to download onto my iPad. I came across a book called Fifteen Thousand Useful Phrases by Grenville Kleiser which was originally published in 1910 and is now in the public domain. I thought it was quite an interesting concept as a book but the means by which this information would be consumed is ineffectual as a book.

It's quite amusing having a flick through some of these phrases, so many are wildly out of date and would feel quite alien and old fashioned to ues them in natural conversation. Some are also a little questionable, but it's an interesting snapshot of history if nothing else.

I was looking into data indexing cloud services (a string of words that would melt the frontal lobes of anyone who was alive in 1910) around the same time and thought that a search indexer of some description would be a way better method of consuming this data. Still working on the most effective method of consuming this data, until such a time as that method is found I'll keep it here...

Child links can be found below to the various chapters of the book, broken up by the type of phrase found within.

## The 2023 attempt

Well I found myself needing to move from dendron back to 11ty for various unimportant reasons, but that meant re-jigging this 'phrasing' thing from dendron-format to... something else. Originally the content was all just on individual half .md, half HTML files, I didn't really feel like remaking all of those individual files so decided to try to build it as some sort of Web App, or online Index, or something...

As ML/LMMs/AI is such a hot topic currently, I wanted to see if ChatGPT could help me solve this annoying problem. I ended up building out a Node.js app and publishing it to Azure, which can be accessed below.
